Beginning Open CV Assignment Completed 

Chapter 3: Using argparse to ask for arguments from the user with add_argument() and then getting and saving it with parse_args() and imread()

Chapter 4: I retrieved pixels to find the average color and then set pixels to be yellow if they were close to the average color

Chapter 5: I used the rectangle and circle drawing functions from opencv

Chapter 6: I use the opencv flip() function to reflect the image and the add() function to make the image more white

skipped chapter 7 cause histograms are annoying

Chapter 8: I used the opencv blur function along with a mask and the numpy where() function to blur just pepper's face so that she's anonymous

Chapter 9: used cvtColor to convert the image to grey scale and then found the optimal threshold with mahotas.thresholding.otsu to convert the pixels in the image to either full black or full white

Chapter 10/11: used Sobel for edge detection, i didn't want to mess with findContours so I made a custom edge detection
